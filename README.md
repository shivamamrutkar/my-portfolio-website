This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It's designed to showcase my journey, skills, and projects as a **Data Analyst & AI Automation Specialist**. The entire site is built from scratch with a focus on a clean, modern aesthetic, and a great user experience.

## ✨ Features

* **Sleek, Modern UI:** A clean and professional design that's easy on the eyes.
* **Fully Responsive:** Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, from large desktops to mobile phones.
* **Light & Dark Mode:** A theme toggle that respects user preferences and saves the choice in local storage.
* **Multi-Page Layout:** Dedicated pages for Home, Work Experience, Projects, and Contact for organized content.
* **Dynamic Animations:** Subtle animations on page load, scroll, and hover to create a polished, interactive feel.
* **Pure Vanilla JS:** Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no frameworks or libraries needed.
